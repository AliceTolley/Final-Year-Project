# Bachelors Project
## Genomic identification of heat-tolerant breed-specific SNPs in West African N'dama cattle
### A collection of the Figures created within RStudio (v4.1.2) as part of a final year Bachelors dissertation.

This project focused on identifying SNPs within heat-tolerance genes found frequently throughout the West African cattle breed N'dama. N'dama breed-specific SNPs found within genes previously described to be involved in heat-tolerance could be used as selective markers to breed for cattle with an increased heat-tolerance; in light of an ever warming climate. 

Using my knowledge of R, learnt during my undergraduate placement year at NIAB EMR, I created 3 Figures within RStudio to highlight the distribution and position of SNPs identified during this project. Providing a further opportunity to continue developing my knowledge of R.
